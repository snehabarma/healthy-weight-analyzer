# Healthy Weight Analyzer ðŸ©º

A mobile app built with **React Native** (Expo) to help **doctors** quickly calculate a patientâ€™s **BMI** and determine **how much weight they need to lose or gain** to fall within a healthy weight range based on height and weight inputs. While users can enter weight in **lb or kg**, all results are automatically converted and displayed in **kilograms (kg)** to maintain standard medical units.

## ðŸ“± Features

- âœ… Input weight in **lb or kg** with automatic conversion to kg
- âœ… Input height in **feet/inches**
- âœ… **Real-time BMI calculation**
- âœ… Shows **minimum and maximum healthy weight** based on standard BMI range (18.5 â€“ 24.9)
- âœ… Tells users **how much weight they need to lose or gain** in kg
- âœ… All output is displayed in **standard medical units (kg)** regardless of input
- ðŸš€ Coming soon: **Visual BMI trends with charts**

## ðŸ§  BMI Formula Used
\[
\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{(\text{Height (m)})^2}
\]
